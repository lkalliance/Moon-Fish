# group-project-1
Moonfish group project


OK, I have named the repo group-project-1, which should give you that name in your file system when you clone it...after you've all cloned it I'll rename the repository. So then on your local it's the logically-named group-project-1, and up here on github it'll be Project Moonfish.

So a reminder on to-dos:

(1) All of us get an api key for weather (which you probably already have) and for geoapify.com
(2) Familiarize yourself with those APIs as best as you can
(3) Consider what we talked about on the wireframing
(4) Familiarize yourself with the Milligram CSS library, AND with doing modals with jQuery or Milligram (I have a feeling Milligram doesn't have them).

Good luck on the weather project!
