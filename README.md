# Moon Fish

## Description
 How Moon Fish came to be. Moon Fish was created using the solunar theory in combination with weather forecasts. Solunar theory hypothesizes that fish move according to the location of the moon in comparison to their bodies. Knowing the time of the tides, sunrise , and sunsets can then help fisherman predict when fish are going to bite. For example during a full moon or new moon fish are more active. This is because the tides intervene. The theory is the large the tide the more active the fish are.

 The user can find this information by typing the city name or zipcode in a search bar. A prompt will then appear to ask the user to confirm if this was the correct location. The user can then name that location which will then be saved for example Home or Favorite Fishing Spot. Once the area is confirmed a small map of the location becomes visible with the weather forecast and solunar periods for seven day forecast.
