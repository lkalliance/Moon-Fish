# group-project-1
Moonfish group project


OK, I have named the repo group-project-1, which should give you that name in your file system when you clone it...after you've all cloned it I'll rename the repository. So then on your local it's the logically-named group-project-1, and up here on github it'll be Project Moonfish.

So a reminder on to-dos:

(1) All of us get an api key for weather (which you probably already have) and for geoapify.com
(2) Familiarize yourself with those APIs as best as you can
(3) Familiarize yourself with the Milligram* CSS library, AND with doing modals with or Milligram (I have a feeling Milligram doesn't have them).

Good luck on the weather project!




(1) API's: Clean up the logic, be able to write to a container, output: LEE
7 days:
--Major Time
--Minor Time
--Daily forecast for each of seven days

(2) Search SAFIA
--Logic to determine if this search has already been saved.
--Logic to pass those search results to (1)
--Decisions about what happens with the search field. Placeholder text? What happens to the search field after I click search?

(3) About us modal: SAFIA
--Describe what Solunar is
--Describe us and why we're doing this project

(4) Seach confirmation modal MICHAEL
--API writes some details to this, we ask user if this is the right place?
--Click yes or no.
--What happens if they click yes? If they click no?
--What happens if the user clicks the close box?

(5) Main display area GABRIELLE
--Show map/Full info about location
--Show seven cards for the next seven days, and info

(6) Design Local Storage LEE/SAFIA
